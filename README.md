# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
We have test scores from students in a school district that we will be analyzing.
### Purpose
With this analysis we hope to gain insight into what schools can lead students to higher success.  We will look at test scores by school size, spending, type of school and will gain insight into what the best steps to take are in order to improve student success.
## Results
After removing ninth grade:
-	The average math score drops by very little, but the percentage of students passing math increases by almost 1 percent.
-	The average reading score does not change very much, but percentage of students passing reading increases by 1 percent.
-	The percentage of students passing both tests increases by about 0.8 percent after removing the ninth grade students.
Changes for Thomas High School:
-	The average math and reading scores increases slightly.
-	The percent passing math decreases by about one percent.
-	The percent passing reading decreases by about 0.3%.
-	The percent passing both tests decreases by about 0.3%.
There really is not much of a change in Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance relative to other schools after removing ninth grade scores.
-	Other than ninth grade being nan there is not change to scores by grade.
-	There were no changes to test scores by spending after removing the students from Thomas High School. 
-	There were also no real changes to scores by school size after removing ninth grade students from Thomas High School.
-	In scores by school type there were really no significant changes to test scores.
## Summary
There were no significant changes to any of the statistics after removing ninth graders from Thomas High School.  The only place where there were changes was in that specific section of ninth graders from Thomas High School where they are all nans now, but outside of that I did not see any changes.
